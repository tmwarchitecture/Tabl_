# Tabl_

Tabl_ is a spreadsheet interface within Rhino for the viewing, editing, and exporting of object properties. Objects are linked to the spreadsheet in real-time, allowing Tabl_ to automatically update as objects are modified.

## Features

* "Live" Spreadsheet interface running while modeling in Rhino.
* Analyze and display multiple object properties simultaneously.
* Live update as objects are modified.
* Display an extensive list of object properties.
* Simple export to spreadsheet friendly formats.
* Sort, count, and total object properties.
* Flexible formatting masks on data points.
* Place the Tabl_ into the Rhino document as text objects.

Tabl_ provides a column and row spreadsheet in which objects can be added and removed from. The user can then check which of the nearly two dozens properties to display as the columns in the spreadsheet. Each column can be sorted to provide a unique way of examining object properties. Tabl_ can also provide totals for numeric properties, allowing instant feedback on how the geometry is meeting project goals. Additionally, multiple options of formatting are available for numbers and colors, depending on the user requirements.

Once finished organizing and formatting the data, Tabl_ can export information to a CSV, or simply copy to the clipboard for pasting into other spreadsheet programs. Tabl_ can also be placed into the Rhino document model space or layout space as editable text objects.

## Versions

0.x versions are cross-platform. Tabl_ can run on Windows and MacOS machines.

1.x versions are deprecated.

2.x versions are for Windows machine only.


## Example Uses

* Architecture schedules.
* Area take-offs.
* Selecting objects based on object property.
* Examining large amounts of geometry.
* Extracting object information.

## Installation

Run the `.rhi` file. You must have Rhino installed on your machine. To remove Tabl_ on a Windows machine, close Rhino first. Then go to "C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\7.0\Plug-ins\" and remove the Tabl_ folder. Restart Rhino and it will be unintalled. 

## Starter Guide

Type "LaunchTabl" in Rhino to call up the main interface. From v2.0 onwards, Tabl_ integrates with Rhino docked panels so it can be snapped and sorted with other tabbed tools.
